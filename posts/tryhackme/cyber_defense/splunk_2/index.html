Then click the <code>Completed</code> button.</p><h4 id=task-2-dive-into-the-data>Task 2: Dive into the data</h4><p>We are roleplaying as Alice Bluebird, an analyst who successfully assisted Wayne Enterprises and was recommended to Grace Hoppy at Frothly to assist them with their recent issues.</p><p>To find out what events we are dealing with use the <code>metadata</code> command to search for the same kind of information found in the Data Summary, while also being able to search within a specific index. Since all time-values are EPOCH time we also need the <code>eval</code> command to provide more human-friendly formatting.</p><p>The following example searches the botsv2 index and returns a listing of all the source types that can be found as well as a count of events and the first time and last time seen.</p><p><code>| metadata type=sourcetypes index=botsv2 | eval firstTime=strftime(firstTime,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") | eval lastTime=strftime(lastTime,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") | eval recentTime=strftime(recentTime,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") | sort - totalCount</code></p><h5 id=question-2>Question 2</h5><p>Click the <code>Completed</code> button.</p><h4 id=task-3-100-series-questions>Task 3: 100 series questions</h4><p>For now we focus on BOTSv2 questions 100-104. Our focus is a person called Amber Turing and her communication with a competitor.</p><p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p><p>Find out what competitor website she visited. Begin with the following command to search for Amber&rsquo;s IP address <code>index="botsv2" amber</code>. This command will produce a lot of events though you can find her IP in the first page. However, to get her IP easily try this <code>index = "botsv2" sourcetype="pan:traffic" amber</code>. This gives us <code>10.0.2.101</code> as her IP.</p><p>Given this information we can build new search queries and focus on her HTTP traffic like this <code>index = "botsv2" IPADDR sourcetype="stream:HTTP"</code>.</p><p>However, this still produces a lot of results to go through just to find the website of the competitor she was looking at. Let&rsquo;s try narrowing it down a bit further by making use of the <code>site</code> field and displaying the output in a table like so <code>index="botsv2" IPADDR sourcetype="stream:HTTP" | dedup site | table site</code>.</p><p>With this search it should be easy to find the website Amber connected to, just think about which company Amber works for and in which industry branch. You can even narrow it down further <code>index="botsv2" IPADDR sourcetype="stream:HTTP" *INDUSTRY* | dedup site | table site</code> giving us <code>www.berkbeer.com</code></p><p><strong>Question 2-7:</strong></p><p>We now know that Amber found the executive contact information and sent him an email. Based on question 2, it has to be an image. With this knowledge it is easy to construct a new query to narrow down Amber&rsquo;s HTTP traffic to the competitor website.</p><p><code>index="botsv2" IPADDR sourcetype="stream:HTTP" COMPETITOR_WEBSITE</code></p><p>Expand on this command to get the specific field we want and output it in table format as previously</p><p>Try <code>index="botsv2" IPADDR sourcetype="stream:HTTP" COMPETITOR_WEBSITE /images/* | table uri_path</code> to get <code>/images/ceoberk.png</code>.</p><p>Now we need Amber&rsquo;s email to look at the SMTP traffic between her and the CEO of berkbeer. Try <code>index="botsv2" sourcetype="stream::SMTP" *amber*</code>, giving us <code>aturing@froth.ly</code> as her email.</p><p>We have the last name of the CEO and Amber&rsquo;s email, to get his full name however we need to focus on the email traffic between Amber and the CEO. Try this command <code>index="botsv2" sourcetype="stream:SMTP" AMBERS_EMAIL COMPETITOR_WEBSITE</code>. Paying attention to the email conversation by looking at the <code>content_body</code> header reveals his full name <code>Martin Berk</code>.</p><p>With all this information we can solve the challenges attached to this task.</p><h5 id=question-3-amber-turing-was-hoping-for-frothly-to-be-acquired-by-a-potential-competitor-which-fell-through-but-visited-their-website-to-find-contact-information-for-their-executive-team-what-is-the-website-domain-that-she-visited>Question 3) Amber Turing was hoping for Frothly to be acquired by a potential competitor which fell through, but visited their website to find contact information for their executive team.

The next thing to look out for is the movie file that was encrypted. By looking at the encrypted PowerPoint file you can find a sourcetype and an extension you can search for to find the other encrypted file like this <code>index="botsv2" host="MACBOOK_NAME" sourcetype="?" *.EXT</code>.</p><p><strong>Question 3-7:</strong></p><p>For the next task we need to provide the name of the manufacturer of the USB drive Kevin used on Mallory&rsquo;s personal MacBook (kutekitten).</p><p>We begin with the MacBook <code>index="botsv2" kutekitten</code>.</p><p>This should result in events from data sources that are related to Osquery. If you don&rsquo;t know Osquery yet I highly recommend doing the <a href=https://tryhackme.com/room/osqueryf8>Osquery</a> room on TryHackMe first. I also have a write up for that <a href=/s-for-security/posts/tryhackme/cyber_defense/osquery/>here</a>.</p><p>Back to the results, try looking for Mallory&rsquo;s user folders, it&rsquo;s a good place to start hunting for malware. Once you have it expand your query like this <code>index="botsv2" kutekitten "\\/PATH\\/MALLORY\\/FOLDER"</code>.</p><p>Looking at the other available interesting fields related to paths can provide you with even better fields to include in your query and look for an interesting file, so make sure to pay attention to them.</p><p>Once you found the file (check its hash in VirusTotal) pivot and look at the events 1 minute prior by clicking on the date/time of the event and selecting in what relation to the current event you want to see others.</p><p>Search queries focused around that specific time segment will then allow you to find the event that was triggered when the USB was inserted. Though the events will not provide the name of the USB manufacturer directly, you have to perform external research on the ID value to get the answer.</p><h5 id=question-17--mallorys-critical-powerpoint-presentation-on-her-macbook-gets-encrypted-by-ransomware-on-august-18-what-is-the-name-of-this-file-after-it-was-encrypted>Question 17) Mallory&rsquo;s critical PowerPoint presentation on her MacBook gets encrypted by ransomware on August 18.
