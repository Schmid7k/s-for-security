On Windows Server 2008, Vista, and XP, TCPView also reports the name of the process that owns the endpoint. TCPView provides a more informative and conveniently presented subset of the Netstat program that ships with Windows.

These programs and drivers include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. Autoruns reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more. Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities.</em></p><p>Autoruns is great to search for malicious programs trying to establish Persistence on the local machine, because it checks for auto-starting applications.</p><p><strong>ProcDump</strong><br><em><strong>ProcDump</strong> is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike.</em></p><p>To learn more about ProcDump visit this <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump>page</a>.</p><p><strong>Process Explorer</strong><br><em>The <strong>Process Explorer</strong> display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that Process Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode you&rsquo;ll see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if Process Explorer is in DLL mode you&rsquo;ll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded.</em></p><p><strong>Process Monitor</strong><br><em><strong>Process Monitor</strong> is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.</em></p><p>ProcMon captures events and activity on the local machine to a <strong>VERY</strong> extensive range. To use it effectively you have to use it with Filters and configure it properly or you will be overwhelmed by the sheer mountain of information generated.</p><p><a href=https://adamtheautomator.com/procmon/>Here</a> is a proper guide to ProcMon.</p><p><strong>PsExec</strong><br><em><strong>PsExec</strong> is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. PsExec&rsquo;s most powerful uses include launching interactive command-prompts on remote systems and remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not have the ability to show information about remote systems.</em></p><p>Due to its features PsExec is a tool adversaries love to use to get a hold on a system.

It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents and subsequently analyzing them, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate on your network.</em></p><p>This tool is <strong>very</strong> comprehensive.
