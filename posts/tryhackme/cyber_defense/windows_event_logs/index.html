They are essential to understand the activities of complex systems, particularly in applications with little user interaction (such as server applications)</em>.</p><p>Basically what this tells you is that the event logs are the first place to query when a machine is experiencing issues, because they can provide clues about the problem&rsquo;s origin.</p><p>Given the information event logs provide it is just as well possible that the combination of log file entries from multiple machines in combination with statistical analysis may turn up correlations between events that seem unrelated at first glance.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why <strong>SIEM</strong> (<strong>Security information and event management</strong>) tools are so powerful. Instead of accessing every machine in an enterprise network by itself, to look at the logs, SIEMs are used to aggregate all that information.</p><h5 id=question-1>Question 1)</h5><p>Start the VM attached to this task and connect to it via Remmina or open split view. Then click the <code>Completed</code> button.</p><h4 id=task-2-event-viewer>Task 2: Event Viewer</h4><p>Since Windows Event Logs are not stored as text files but rather in .evt or .evtx format it is not possible to view them using a text editor. Instead you can access them through Windows built-in tools.</p><p>The first tool we are looking at is the GUI application <strong>Event Viewer</strong>.
Event Viewer is divided into 3 panes. The left pane holds a tree listing the event log providers. The middle pane display a general overview and summary or the events specified to the selected provider. The right is the actions pane.</p><p>Windows Events are categorized into 5 types:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Event type</th><th style=text-align:center>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Error</td><td style=text-align:center>Indicates loss of data/functionality, e.g. if a service fails to load during startup.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Warning</td><td style=text-align:center>Not necessarily significant but indicates a possible future problem, e.g. low disk space.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Information</td><td style=text-align:center>Describes a successful operation of an application/driver/service, e.g. successfully loading a driver.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Success Audit</td><td style=text-align:center>Events that record successful, audited security access, e.g. when a user logs in successfully.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Failure Audit</td><td style=text-align:center>Opposite of Success Audit.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Standard Windows logs are visible by selecting <strong>Windows Logs</strong> in the left pane. Each log has an explanation:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Log</th><th style=text-align:center>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Application</td><td style=text-align:center>Events logged by applications, e.g. file error recorded by a database operation.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Security</td><td style=text-align:center>Valid/Invalid login attempts and resource events such as creating/opening/deleting files.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>System</td><td style=text-align:center>Events logged by system components, e.g. driver failure during startup</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>CustomLog</td><td style=text-align:center>Events logged by applications that create custom logs.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The next section in th left pane is <strong>Applications and Services Logs</strong>. Here you can go down <code>Microsoft > Windows > Powershell > Operational</code> to see log events created by using PowerShell.</p><p>Use this to explore how Event Logger displays event information and how to change and filter for logging properties.</p><h5 id=question-2>Question 2)</h5><p>Open the <code>Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational</code> log in Event Viewer.</p><h5 id=question-3-what-is-the-event-id-for-the-first-event>Question 3) What is the Event ID for the first event?</h5><p>Scroll through the list of events until you find the first event logged for PowerShell.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> 40961</p><h5 id=question-4-filter-on-event-id-4104-what-was-the-2nd-command-executed-in-the-powershell-session>Question 4) Filter on Event ID 4104.

You can also use this command to install and uninstall event manifests, to run queries, and to export, archive, and clear logs.</em></p><p>Access its help file by calling <code>wevtutil.exe /?</code> and try to understand how to use it.</p><h5 id=question-8-how-many-log-names-are-in-the-machine>Question 8) How many log names are in the machine?</h5><p>You may need to research into how to count line numbers of command output.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Execute <code>wevtutil el | find /c /v ""</code>. This command prints out all log names and pipes the output to <code>find</code> which then counts the lines.

Everything is based on the <code>merged.evtx</code> file found on the Desktop of this room&rsquo;s virtual machine and there are different scenarios to play through:</p><p><em>Scenario 1 (Quesions 1 & 2)</em>: The server admins have made numerous complaints to Management regarding PowerShell being blocked in the environment. Management finally approved the usage of PowerShell within the environment. Visibility is now needed to ensure there are no gaps in coverage. You researched this topic: what logs to look at, what event IDs to monitor, etc. You enabled PowerShell logging on a test machine and had a colleague execute various commands.</p><p><em>Scenario 2 (Questions 3 & 4)</em>: The Security Team is using Event Logs more. They want to ensure they can monitor if event logs are cleared. You assigned a colleague to execute this action.</p><p><em>Scenario 3 (Questions 5, 6, & 7)</em>: The threat intel team shared its research on Emotet. They advised searching for event ID 4104 and the text &ldquo;ScriptBlockText&rdquo; within the EventData element. Find the encoded PowerShell payload.</p><p><em>Scenario 4 (Questions 8 & 9)</em>: A report came in that an intern was suspected of running unusual commands on her machine, such as enumerating members of the Administrators group.
