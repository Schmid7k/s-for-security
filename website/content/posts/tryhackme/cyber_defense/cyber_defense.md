Taken from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/):

_The [Cyber Defense](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/blueteam/join) path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas necessary to detect and respond to threats. This path will be looking at the following areas:_

    - Getting Started
    - Threat and Vulnerability Management
    - Security Operations and Monitoring
    - Threat Emulation
    - Incident Response & Forensics
    - Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

_Once you complete this path, you should have the fundamental components of detecting and responding to threats in a corporate environment and using these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within this field._
