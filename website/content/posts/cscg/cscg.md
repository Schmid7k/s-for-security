Translated from [cscg.de](https://www.cscg.de/about/):

The annual Cyber Security Challenge Germany is part of the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC), which offers interested young people from 22 European countries a platform to compete online and on-site in IT security challenges.

Youths and young adults between the ages of 14 and 25 can participate. Prior knowledge of IT security is not required. There are tasks at different levels of difficulty, making it easier for beginners to get started and also providing a challenge for experts.

A solid basic knowledge of general computer science, a love of puzzles and an interest in IT security are good prerequisites.

Participants and interested parties can exchange ideas via our Discord server. Especially new participants are invited to get to know their fellow players and the team.

The competition is structured in "Capture the Flag" style and is organized by experienced former participants and CTF players. The tasks cover different areas of IT security, for example cryptography, web applications, reverse engineering or network security.

The German qualification round takes place online every year from March 1 to June 1. The ten best participants in each of the age groups Junior (14 to 20 years) and Senior (21 to 25 years) are invited to the German final, which takes place at the beginning of July.

After the final round, a junior and a senior team of five participants each will be created to represent Germany at the European Cyber Security Challenge.
