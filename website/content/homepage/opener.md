I created this website to keep everything I learned from CTF challenges handy in one place. Creating Write Ups helps me to process all the tricks and ideas from CTF challenges and Penetration Tests and it is really nice to be able to refer back to them when in doubt.
I also thought it would be helpful for anyone who enjoys participating in CTF challenges and could use some advice here and there. So hopefully my Write Ups are as useful to you as they are to me. Happy Hacking!
